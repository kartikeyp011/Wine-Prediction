# Wine-Prediction
My first ML project that predicts wine quality


**What is it?**
This project is about using a computer program to figure out if a wine is "good" or "bad" based on its chemical properties. 

**How does it work?**
1. **Data Collection:** We have a file with information about different wines, including details like acidity, sweetness, and alcohol content, along with their quality ratings.

2. **Preparing Data:** We take this information and prepare it for the computer to understand. We split the data into two parts: one for teaching the program and one for testing it.

3. **Training the Model:** We use a method called RandomForestClassifier to train the computer. This is like teaching it to recognize patterns in the data so it can make predictions.

4. **Testing the Model:** After teaching, we test how well the program learned by checking its predictions against known data.

5. **Making Predictions:** Once trained, the program can predict if a new wine is "good" or "bad" based on its properties.

**Why is it useful?**
It helps in quickly determining the quality of wine without tasting it, which can be useful for wine producers, sellers, and buyers.
